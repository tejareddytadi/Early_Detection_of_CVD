# **Early Detection of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)** ðŸ©º

This repository focuses on the **early detection of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)** using various machine learning algorithms. The project evaluates several models, such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **AdaBoost**, **XGBoost**, and **Decision Trees**, to determine the most effective method for predicting the likelihood of CVD based on patient data.

The study has been published in **ICSSIT 2024**, emphasizing the importance of early detection of CVD through efficient predictive models.

## **Project Overview** ðŸ“Š

Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are among the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection critical. The aim of this project is to use machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for CVD detection, helping healthcare professionals intervene early and improve patient outcomes.

### **Key Highlights:**
- Multiple machine learning models are evaluated: **SVM**, **AdaBoost**, **XGBoost**, and **Decision Trees**.
- Three diverse datasets are analyzed to assess the robustness and performance of each model.
- The models are evaluated based on metrics like **accuracy**, **sensitivity (true positive rate)**, **false positive rate**, and others.
- Results show the strengths and weaknesses of each model in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and suitability for specific datasets.

## **Machine Learning Models** ðŸ”§
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, good for CVD prediction tasks.
- **AdaBoost**: An ensemble learning algorithm that improves weak learners, useful for early detection.
- **XGBoost**: An efficient gradient-boosting algorithm that performs well with complex datasets.
- **Decision Tree**: A versatile and interpretable model, often used in medical diagnosis.
